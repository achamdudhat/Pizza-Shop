# Pizza-Shop

This code is divided into four parts:
1) Obtaining the order:
    If the customer selects any option from 1 to 5 (pizza menu), the program responds by displaying 
 a second menu of sizes and corresponding prices. If the customer selects 1 through 4 (size menu), 
the program prompts the customer to enter a quantity, then 
calculates and displays the current order total, formatted as currency. If the customer enters an 
invalid choice for either menu, the program displays an error message, then prompts the customer to 
enter a valid choice until s/he does so. If the customer enters a quantity of 0 (zero) or less, the 
program similarly displays an appropriate error message, then prompts the customer to enter a valid 
quantity until s/he does so. Part 1 of the program “loops” until the customer selects 6 to exit the 
pizza menu. 
2) Display Order:
  The program will then display the order summary
3) Payment Process:
  The program will ask the customer how they will pay. If the customer inters a card number less 
than 16 digits then the program will display a message accordingly
4) Enjoy Pizza:
  The program will conclude with Thank you message
